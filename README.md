# Australia's coastal structures

Australia's coastline is facing increasing pressures from erosion, exacerbated by rising sea levels and extreme weather events. To determine which parts of the coast are vulnerable, it’s crucial to identify areas protected by coastal structures such as sea walls, groynes, and wharfs.

This repo and accompanying [RMarkdown notebook](https://julianog.github.io/oz_osm_coastal_structures/oz_osm_coastal_structures.html) document the analysis and efforts to consolidate spatial data on coastal protection structures, such as sea walls, groynes, and wharfs, across Australia's coastline. The project addresses the urgent need for a national-level dataset by sourcing data from various state governments and identifying gaps in coverage. The dataset integrates contributions from OpenStreetMap (OSM), Smartline, and state-based government databases, resulting in a research-quality geospatial file. Key attributes include the location and type of coastal structures, with data standardised for consistency across regions. Limitations are noted, such as the absence of government-supplied data for certain regions and potential accuracy issues with OSM-sourced information. The dataset is intended for research purposes, supporting efforts to assess coastal risks and guide future protection measures. Ongoing updates to datasets will extend to not only consider engineered hard structures but also include datasets of nature-based coastal protection (e.g., restored reefs and coastal vegetation).
